## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Color Palette
**Light Theme:**
- Primary: #2c3e50 (Professional dark blue)
- Background: #ffffff (Clean white)
- Surface: #f8f9fa (Light gray for cards/sections)
- Text: #2c3e50 (High contrast for readability)

**Dark Theme:**
- Primary: #ecf0f1 (Soft white)
- Background: #1a1a1a (True dark for reduced eye strain)
- Surface: #2c2c2c (Dark gray for elevated elements)
- Text: #ecf0f1 (High contrast light text)

### Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast ratios in both themes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements
