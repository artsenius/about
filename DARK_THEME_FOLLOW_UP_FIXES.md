# üé® Dark Theme Follow-Up Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Issues Addressed

Following your additional feedback on PR #7, I've successfully implemented all the requested dark theme improvements:

## ‚úÖ **Issue 1: Remove Page Titles**
**Request**: Remove page titles from About This App, Live Test Automation, and Contact pages.

**Implementation**:
- **About This App**: Removed `<Title>About This App</Title>` component
- **Live Test Automation**: Removed `<Title>Live Test Automation</Title>` component  
- **Contact**: Removed `<Title>Get in Touch</Title>` component

**Result**: All pages now have cleaner layouts without redundant titles (navigation already shows current page)

## ‚úÖ **Issue 2: Contact Page Containers Too Bright in Dark Mode**
**Request**: Contact page containers (Email, Phone, LinkedIn) need dark backgrounds with bright text.

**Implementation**:
- **ContactCard**: Updated to use `theme.colors.surface` for dark backgrounds
- **ContactIcon**: Made theme-aware with `theme.colors.text`
- **ContactLabel**: Updated to use `theme.colors.text` for proper contrast
- **ContactLink**: Made theme-aware with `theme.colors.text` and `theme.colors.accent` hover
- **CopyButton**: Enhanced with theme-aware colors and improved hover states
- **Borders & Shadows**: Added theme-aware borders and shadows for better definition

**Result**: Contact cards now have proper dark backgrounds with bright, readable text in dark mode

## ‚úÖ **Issue 3: Test Automation Page Dark Theme Issues**
**Request**: Make test results more dark green in dark mode and fix bright expanded details.

**Implementation**:

### Test Results Color Enhancement:
- **Updated `getStatusColor` function** to accept `isDarkMode` parameter
- **Changed passed test color** from bright green (`#27ae60`) to dark blue (`#1d4ed8`) in dark mode
- **Enhanced TestRunHeader** to use the new color system with smooth transitions

### Expanded Details Dark Theme Support:
- **TestSummary**: Dark background (`theme.colors.surface`) with theme-aware borders
- **TestSuite**: Dark backgrounds with proper contrast borders
- **TestCase**: Enhanced with dark mode-specific colors:
  - Passed tests: Dark blue background (`#0f172a`) with blue borders (`#1e40af`)
  - Failed tests: Dark red background (`#1e1b1b`) maintaining red borders
  - All cases: Theme-aware text colors and transitions
- **SummaryLabel/SummaryValue**: Theme-aware text colors for better readability
- **SuiteTitle**: Dark mode text colors with theme-aware borders

**Result**: Test automation page now has professional dark styling with improved contrast and readability
