# üé® Dark Theme Fixes - PR #7 Improvements

## Issues Addressed

Based on your feedback regarding PR #7, I've successfully fixed the following dark theme issues:

### ‚úÖ **Issue 1: Header too bright in dark mode**
**Problem**: The header in dark mode was using a very light color (`#ecf0f1`) instead of the dark color that the footer uses.

**Solution**: 
- **Updated dark theme primary color** from `#ecf0f1` to `#2c3e50` in `src/config/theme.ts`
- **Made Footer theme-aware** to use the same primary color as header for consistency
- **Result**: Header and footer now both use the same dark color (`#2c3e50`) in dark mode, creating a cohesive dark theme experience

### ‚úÖ **Issue 2: About App Project Components too bright in dark mode** 
**Problem**: The Project Components (Frontend, Backend, Test Automation) on the "About this app" page were using light backgrounds (`#f8f9fa`) that were too bright in dark mode.

**Solution**:
- **Added theme support to AboutApp component** by importing and using `useTheme()` hook
- **Updated TechItem styled components** to use theme-aware colors:
  - Background: `theme.colors.surface` (dark gray in dark mode)
  - Text: `theme.colors.text` (light text in dark mode)
  - Border: `theme.colors.border` (appropriate contrast borders)
- **Added smooth transitions** for theme switching
- **Made all typography theme-aware** (titles, section headers)
